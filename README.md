# Hacker Calendar 2024 

Dear cybersecurity professionals! 

If you don't like ordinary civilian holidays, remember that we have our own holidays.

I've collected 42 dates so far, but I need your help.  What would you add to this calendar? 

Please write in Issues (or in the comments on Twitter) to remove or add.

If you opened this repository in February or August you can still write responses and maybe by 2025 we'll have a good calendar.

If you don't agree with this calendar at all, you can take the blank template from this repository and make your own. I'm really really interested to see it!
